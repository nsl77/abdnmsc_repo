## This report documents my first attempts of using Git and Github to version control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging, and committing changes and then pushing to my Github repository.

## Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r cars}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```
## A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
